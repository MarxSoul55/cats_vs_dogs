## Requested Contributions
1. Figure out a way to get TensorFlow's [SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/saved_model#overview_of_saving_and_restoring_models)
to work as a replacement for `tf.train.Saver` for saving and loading not just the model, but also
all relevant variables and operations (e.g. objective function, summary ops, etc.). Please make all
contributions compliant with [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/).
