**ATTN: This project is being superseded by [Iris](https://github.com/MarxSoul55/Iris), a pipeline for supervised learning and classification of images with convolutional neural networks. Iris is designed to be more general-purpose project, capable of dealing with any number of classes of a variety of types, not just the two classes—cats and dogs—featured in this project.**

**With regards to this project—at least for now, I will cease development. I wish to fully "flesh out" Iris' features before resuming development on this one, if I ever choose to do so. I love this project, and have quite a bit of nostalgia for it, but for the time being—this is it.**

# Hello World!  :earth_americas:
This repository contains code for a computer-vision program to discern the difference between two
common household animals. The program uses a machine learning algorithm called a *convolutional
neural network*.

This algorithm has been implemented in two popular software libraries—[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org). The data used to train the model was [Kaggle's dataset of cat and dog pictures](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data).

# Want to use and modify this program?
### If you have no idea what you're doing here...
If you want to use and modify this program to your fullest potential, you'll need to have *a lot*
of background knowledge about artificial neural-networks and machine-learning in general. There's
no easy way around these requirements, unfortunately. You have to put in the time, read lots of
books and blog-posts, take online-courses, etc. Going beyond this point, I'll assume you have that
knowledge, since I do not have anywhere near the time to explain everything. I will list a few
resources, however:
* http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
    * Great online book. Many people will list this as a resource if you ask around. Well-written
      and very informative.
* http://cs231n.github.io/
    * Lecture-notes and other resources from a course at Stanford University.
    * Also see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC&index=0
        * These are video-lectures for the notes in question! Very, very helpful!
* https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
    * Another well-respected resource like the first one listed. If you want a more traditional
      "lecture and listen" setting, this will suffice.
* http://www.deeplearningbook.org/
    * A bit of a newbie on the field, but has some top-notch authors behind it. They're well-known
      and well-respected in the field of AI.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk
    * This video was created by 3Blue1Brown as part of a series, which is actually being created as
      I speak (October 15th, 2017). 3Blue1Brown has a reputation of teaching things in an intuitive
      manner with lots of nice visualizations.
* https://adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/
    * A short introduction on the inner-workings of convolutional neural networks, a very popular
      machine learning algorithm (as of 2018) and the algorithm that this program uses for image
      recognition!
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs&list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU
    * This video is part of a short series on artificial neural-networks. It's just a small
      overview of some of the general concepts. It does throw in a few implementation-level
      concepts, like gradient-descent with matrices, which is a nice feature.

Even having a solid background in machine-learning, you still need to (obviously) know how to
program in Python and how to use the TensorFlow framework. There are so many tutorials for both of
these that I won't even bother to list any, as a google-search will yield everything you seek.
### If you do have an idea of what you're doing...
