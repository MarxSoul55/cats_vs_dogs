## Hello, World!
This repository contains the code for a computer-vision program. Using a convolutional
neural-network (made with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)), this program can tell
whether a cat or dog is in a given picture.

The data used to train the model was [Kaggle's dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data)
